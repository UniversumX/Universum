## Model Development

# EEGFormer for EEG and Accelerometer Data Prediction

This project involves using a deep learning model, specifically an adapted version of the EEGFormer, to predict accelerometer data from EEG data. The model leverages the transformer architecture to process EEG signals and output corresponding accelerometer readings.

## Project Structure

- `model.py`: Contains the implementation of the EEGFormer model, including the CNN1D for EEG feature extraction and the transformer blocks for processing the EEG data.
- `data_loader.py`: Custom data loader for reading and preprocessing EEG and accelerometer data from EDF files.
- `train.py`: The main script for training the EEGFormer model on your dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required for this project.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- MNE-Python
- Numpy

Install the necessary Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

Your EDF files should contain synchronized EEG and accelerometer data. The EEG data should be present in the first few channels, followed by the accelerometer data in the subsequent channels.

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Configure the Model**: Adjust the model parameters in `model.py` according to your dataset's specifics, like the number of EEG channels, sequence length, and output dimensions for the accelerometer data.

2. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Use `data_loader.py` to load your EDF file and preprocess the data. Ensure that the EEG and accelerometer data are correctly extracted and synchronized.

3. **Run Training**: Execute `train.py` to start training the model. This script will use the data loader to feed data into the EEGFormer model and perform backpropagation based on the loss between the predicted and actual accelerometer data.

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

### Monitoring Training Progress

The training script will output the loss at each epoch, allowing you to monitor the training progress. Adjust the training epochs, learning rate, and other hyperparameters as needed.

## Model Details

- **CNN1D**: Used for initial feature extraction from the raw EEG data.
- **EEGFormerEncoder**: Consists of Temporal, Synchronous, and Regional transformers to process the EEG data.
- **EEGFormerDecoderForRegression**: Adapted to output continuous accelerometer data.

## Customization

You can customize the model architecture, data preprocessing steps, and training loop in the provided scripts to better suit your dataset and requirements.
