# This example defines a simple LSTM model with 64 units, the input shape must be adjusted to your data, and a dense layer with 3 units at the output. 
# The model is then trained on the training data and the prediction is made on the test dataset.

# Please keep in mind that this is just an example, and that you may need to experiment with different architectures, 
# and different parameters to find the best configuration 
# for your specific dataset and problem.

# Additionally, this example is just a skeleton 



# we can also use a transformer model,
